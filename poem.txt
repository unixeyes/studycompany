The olive tree
Don't ask from where I have come 
My home is far, far away 
Why do you wander so far 
Wander so far, 
wander so far 

For the little bird flying in the sky
For the blue brook running in the mountain 
For the broad meadow green and wide
I wander, wander so far 

Then, is there more? 
Yes, for the Olive tree of my dream 
Don't ask from where I have come 
My home is far, far away 
Why do you wander? 
Why do you wander so far? 
Far, far away 
For the Olive tree of my dream 

Don't ask from where I have come 
My home is far, far away 
Why do you wander so far 
Wander so far, wander so far
